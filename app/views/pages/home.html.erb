	<p class="lead">I have designed this site to act as a resume of sorts and host links to all the projects I have designed and built. Both this site and my other projects are constantly evolving to keep up with the latest and greatest, and I am proud to be able to show off my work. Please look around and reach out to me with any questions!</p>
